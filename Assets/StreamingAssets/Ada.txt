Why hello! Aren't you a funny looking thing!
...
A human? Out here?! How fascinating! You know, I'd love to chat, but I'm a tad... preoccupied. 
Wait! While you're here...
I've lost something very dear to me. A red corundum -- a ruby, if you will. Bring it to me, and I'll end this conflict. 

You found the ruby! Fantastic! 
Take it further into my domain, to your right. Place it in the alter and we can settle this. 
Please, help us machines.
