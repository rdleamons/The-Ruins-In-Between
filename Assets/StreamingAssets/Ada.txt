Why hello! Aren't you a funny looking thing!
...
A human? Out here?! How fascinating! You know, I'd love to chat, but I'm a tad... preoccupied. 
Wait! While you're here...
I've lost something very dear to me. A red corundum -- a ruby, if you will. Bring it to me, and I'll end this conflict. 

You found the ruby! Fantastic! 
You should give that to me. It's for the good of the machines.
