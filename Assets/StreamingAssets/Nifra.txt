Who dares awaken me?
A mortal? I haven't seen your kind in decades. 
You should leave. It's too dangerous for someone like you.
...
If you must stay...
I've lost something very dear to me. A ruby. Find it, and I will end this conflict once and for all. 
 
You actually found it. I'm impressed. 
You should give that to me. It's for the good of the forest.
