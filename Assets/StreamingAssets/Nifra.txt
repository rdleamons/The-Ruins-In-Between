Who dares awaken me?
A mortal? I haven't seen your kind in decades. 
You should leave. It's too dangerous for someone like you.
...
If you must stay...
I've lost something very dear to me. A ruby. Find it, and I will end this conflict once and for all. 
 
You actually found my ruby. I'm impressed. 
Take it into my domain to your left. With the ruby back where it belongs, we can end this.
...Please. Help the forest.
